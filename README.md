deluge-copycompleted
This plugin for Deluge copies downloaded files to another location.

It can only be configured via the web interface (or by hand); there is no GTK UI for this plugin.

It works fine for me, but if there are any issues, feel free to drop me an email at sam@edgylogic.com, or better yet, fork, fix, and I'll pull your changes.

Based on: https://github.com/slai/deluge-copycompleted

Extended to use labels in directory
